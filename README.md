- 👋 Hi, I’m @JossMilon, I have plenty of ideas 💡 and try to give it substance through code 🧑‍💻 though I'm still super beginner 🐣. 
- 🌱 I’m focusing on Javascript language and got into it thanks to (the amazing) FreeCodeCamp and a (super great) french coding bootcamp called "Le Reacteur" 🚀.
- I'd like to mix my appentence for marketing with tech skills, thus moving to growth engineering someday.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on any project that can help me hone my skills, ideally open source and / or for charities.
- 📫 Reach out to me via email @josselin.milon@lilo.org to work on common projects or come sparring on Codewars - https://www.codewars.com/users/Gjloss
