- 👋 Hi, I’m @JossMilon, I valued inventors more than anyone since forever. And Indiana Jones 🤠 (but different story). 
- Becoming a developer enables me to give substance to my ideas 💡. 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Javascript, thanks to FreeCodeCamp and attended french coding bootcamp called "Le Reacteur" 🚀.
- I'd like to mix my appentence for marketing with tech skills, thus moving to growth engineering.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on any project that can help me hone my skills, ideally open source and / or for charities.
- 📫 Reach out to me via email @josselin.milon@lilo.org
